# Database

Database course - Spring 2022
-----------------------------
In this course we learned about designing databases and SQL commands, and we implemented databases and manipulated its content using SQL commands.

For our project we implemented the dataset for a covid application to track and record covid-related data about people and locations to notify them about safe places and help control the pandemic.
